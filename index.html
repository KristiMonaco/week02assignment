    <!--main: I will add photos I took in these places and a brief little write-up about each city in each section.
         (Note to mentor: I know our first lab was about Tokyo but I had already planned on doing my fisrt web page 
         about cities I've traveled to, including Tokyo)-->
       
         <h2>Istanbul, Türkiye</h2>
   <div class="group1">

   </div>
       <p>Istanbul is the oldest city in the world that still exists today. The Ayasofya mosque was built nearly 2,700 years ago and still stands. 
          Incredible! The city straddles two continents and is a captivating tapestry of past and present where east meets west.
          Istanbul's neighborhoods are like a mosaic, each with its own unique character. As you wander the streets,
          every step you take is a journey through time and culture.</p>
   

      
         <h2>Bogotá, Colombia</h2>
   <div class="group1">

   </div>
       <p>Bogotá is nested at 8,660 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains. It is the largest city in Colombia and a cultural hub
          known for its historic charm dating back to the Spanish colonial era. It has a bustling urban environment and is known for 
          its thriving street art scene, unique cuisine, diverse population and natural beauty.</p>
       

       
        <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2>
   <div class="group1">
    <img src="week1pics/image:tokyo1.jpg" alt="tokyo street scene" id="p11">
    <img src="week1pics/IMG_5224 copy.JPG" alt="tokyo street scene" id="p12">
    <img src="week1pics/IMG_5227 copy.JPG" alt="tokyo street scene" id="p13">
    <img src="week1pics/IMG_5326 copy.JPG" alt="tokyo temple" id="p14">
    <img src="week1pics/IMG_5355 copy.JPG" alt="tokyo street scene" id="p15">
   </div>
       <p>Tokyo is probably the biggest city in the world, and a unique place where tradition and innovation seamlessly coexist,
          creating a mezmerizing blend of old-world charm and futuristic wonder. I love the crowded nature of the city
          and all the interesting architecture, fashion, food, shrines, temples and parks.</p>
